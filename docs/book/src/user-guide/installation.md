# Installation

Follow this guide to install the Node Readiness Controller in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

If you plan to use the `install-full.yaml` option (which includes secure metrics and the validating admission webhook), you must first have [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) installed in your cluster.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Official Release (Recommended)

First, to install the CRDs, apply the `crds.yaml` manifest:

```sh
# Replace with the desired version
VERSION=v0.1.1
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller/releases/download/${VERSION}/crds.yaml
kubectl wait --for condition=established --timeout=30s crd/nodereadinessrules.readiness.node.x-k8s.io

```

#### 2. Install the Controller

Choose one of the two following manifests based on your requirements:

| Manifest | Contents | Prerequisites |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`install.yaml`** | Core Controller | None |
| **`install-full.yaml`** | Core Controller + Metrics (Secure) + Validation Webhook | `cert-manager` |

**Standard Installation (Minimal):**
The simplest way to deploy the controller with no external dependencies.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller/releases/download/${VERSION}/install.yaml
```

**Full Installation (Production Ready):**
Includes secure metrics (TLS-protected) and validating webhooks for rule conflict prevention. **Requires [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/)** to be installed in your cluster.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller/releases/download/${VERSION}/install-full.yaml
```

This will deploy the controller into the `nrr-system` namespace on any available node in your cluster.

#### Controller priority

The controller is deployed with `system-cluster-critical` priority to prevent eviction during node resource pressure.

If it gets evicted during resource pressure, nodes can't transition to Ready state, blocking all workload scheduling cluster-wide.

This is the priority class used by other critical cluster components (eg: core-dns).

#### Images

The official releases use multi-arch images (AMD64, Arm64) and are available at `registry.k8s.io/node-readiness-controller/node-readiness-controller`

```sh
REPO="registry.k8s.io/node-readiness-controller/node-readiness-controller"
TAG=$(skopeo list-tags docker://$REPO | jq .'Tags[-1]' | tr -d '"')
docker pull $REPO:$TAG
```
### Option 2: Advanced Deployment (Kustomize)

If you need deeper customization, you can use Kustomize directly from the source.

```sh
# 1. Install CRDs
kubectl apply -k config/crd

# 2. Deploy Controller with default configuration
kubectl apply -k config/default
```

You can enable optional components (Metrics, TLS, Webhook) by creating a `kustomization.yaml` that includes the relevant components from the `config/` directory. For reference on how these components can be combined, see the `deploy-with-metrics`, `deploy-with-tls`, `deploy-with-webhook`, and `deploy-full` targets in the projects [`Makefile`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller/blob/main/Makefile).

### Option 3: Deploy as a Static Pod (Control Plane)

Running the controller as a **Static Pod** on control-plane nodes is useful for self-managed clusters (e.g., `kubeadm`) where you want the controller to be available alongside core components like the API server.

Refer to the `examples/static-pod/node-readiness-controller.yaml` for a detailed
example on deploying the controller as a static pod in a kind cluster.

#### Deployment Steps

1.  **Prepare the Manifest**:
    Refer the example manifest in
    `examples/static-pod/node-readiness-controller.yaml`. This manifest handles kubeconfig with a `initContainer` and necessary flags for leader election.

2.  **Deploy to Nodes**:
    Use Ansible / Terraform to copy the manifest to the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` directory on each control-plane node. The Kubelet will automatically detect and start the pod.

3.  **Install CRDs**:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -k config/crd
    ```
    This is typically handled via a bootstrap script or post-install job in a `kubeadm` setup.

## Avoiding a Duplicate Installation

The controller manages node taints, so only one installation should run in a cluster.
Two installations reconciling the same `NodeReadinessRule` resources will both act on
the same nodes.

This is easy to do by accident on a managed cluster. Where the control plane is hosted,
the provider may already run the controller as part of it, and that installation is not
visible to you in the usual places.

### Finding the existing installation

The CRD is cluster-scoped and singleton, so it is the one artifact every installation
shares. It carries the standard `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` label naming the
installer that owns it:

```sh
kubectl get crd nodereadinessrules.readiness.node.x-k8s.io \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.app\.kubernetes\.io/managed-by}'
```

The value is the installer: `helm` from the chart, `kustomize` from the config
manifests, or a provider's own name when they override it (see below).

If the CRD is not present, the controller is not installed.

### For providers

Providers installing the controller should override the label value so it identifies
them rather than the `helm`/`kustomize` default, which makes the hosted installation
self-describing to users:

```yaml
# kustomize patch
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: nodereadinessrules.readiness.node.x-k8s.io
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: example-provider
```

### Helm guardrail

A fresh `helm install` runs two checks and aborts if either one finds an existing
installation:

1. **CRD ownership.** If the `NodeReadinessRule` CRD already carries a
   `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` value different from the one this chart claims
   (`helm`, set by `crds.managedBy`), another installer owns it — a `kustomize`
   install, or a provider's `<provider>`. This catches a hosted provider install
   even when its workload is renamed or hidden. A self reinstall passes, because the
   CRD Helm leaves behind still carries `helm`.
2. **Running workload.** If a controller Deployment labelled
   `app.kubernetes.io/name=node-readiness-controller` is already running, the install
   is refused and the Deployment is named. This catches a second Helm release, which
   check 1 cannot distinguish because it carries the same `managed-by` value.

The workload check names the offending Deployment in the error:

```console
$ helm install nrc ./charts/node-readiness-controller
Error: node-readiness-controller is already installed in this cluster.

The Deployment kube-system/node-readiness-controller-manager is already running the
controller.
...
```

The guard keys on the running controller Deployment, not on the CRD: Helm installs the
CRD from `crds/` before it renders templates, so the CRD always exists by the time the
check runs. The Deployment is applied after rendering, so one found during the check
belongs to a different, already-running installation.

`helm upgrade` is unaffected. To install anyway, set `crds.preInstallCheck=false`.

> [!NOTE]
> The check only runs during a real install. It is skipped by `helm template` and
> `helm install --dry-run`, which do not query the cluster. It matches Deployments
> labelled `app.kubernetes.io/name=node-readiness-controller`; an installation that
> renames the workload, or does not use this chart, is not detected.

The other install paths -- `kubectl apply` of the release manifests, or Kustomize --
do not have an equivalent guard. Check the label above before installing.

## Verification

After installation, verify that the controller is running successfully. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Replace `${NAMESPACE}` with the namespace where the controller is deployed (typically `nrr-system` for standard deployments, or `kube-system` for static pods).

1.  **Check Pod Status**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE} -l component=node-readiness-controller
    ```
    You should see the controller pods in `Running` status.

2.  **Check Logs**:
    ```sh
    kubectl logs -n ${NAMESPACE} -l component=node-readiness-controller
    ```
    Look for "Starting EventSource" or "Starting Controller" messages indicating the manager is active.

3.  **Verify CRDs**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get crd nodereadinessrules.readiness.node.x-k8s.io
    ```

4. **Verify High Availability**:
    In an HA cluster, verify that one instance has acquired the leader lease:
    ```sh
    # The lease namespace should match the controller's namespace (configured via --leader-election-namespace)
    kubectl get lease -n ${NAMESPACE} ba65f13e.readiness.node.x-k8s.io
    ```

## Uninstallation

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Follow this order to avoid "stuck" resources.

The controller uses a **finalizer** (`readiness.node.x-k8s.io/cleanup-taints`) on `NodeReadinessRule` resources to ensure taints are safely removed from nodes before a rule is deleted.

> [!CAUTION]
> You must delete all rule objects *before* deleting the controller.

1.  **Delete all Rules**:
    ```sh
    kubectl delete nodereadinessrules --all
    ```
    *Wait for this command to complete.* This ensures the running controller removes its taints from your nodes.

2.  **Uninstall Controller**:
    ```sh
    # If installed via release manifest
    kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller/releases/download/${VERSION}/install.yaml
    
    # Or if using the full manifest
    kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller/releases/download/${VERSION}/install-full.yaml

    # OR if using Kustomize
    kubectl delete -k config/default

    # OR if using Static Pods
    # Remove the manifest from /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ on all control-plane nodes
    ```

3.  **Uninstall CRDs** (Optional):
    ```sh
    kubectl delete -k config/crd
    ```

### Recovering from Stuck Resources

If you accidentally deleted the controller *before* the rules, the `NodeReadinessRule` objects will get stuck in a `Terminating` state because the controller is needed to cleanup the taints and finalizers.

To force-delete them (this will require you to manually clean up the managed taints if any on your nodes):

```sh
# Patch the finalizer to remove it
kubectl patch nodereadinessrule <rule-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
```

## Troubleshooting Deployment

**RBAC Permissions**
If the controller logs show "Forbidden" errors, verify the ClusterRole bindings:
```sh
kubectl describe clusterrole nrr-manager-role
```
It requires `nodes` (update/patch) and `nodereadinessrules` (all) access.

**Debug Logging**
To enable verbose logging for deeper investigation:
```sh
kubectl patch deployment -n nrr-system nrr-controller-manager \
  -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"manager","args":["--zap-log-level=debug"]}]}}}}'
```
