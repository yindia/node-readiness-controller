# Monitoring

Node Readiness Controller exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics. This page describes the Prometheus metrics exposed by Node Readiness Controller for monitoring rule evaluation, taint operations, failures, and bootstrap progress.

## Metrics Endpoint

The controller serves metrics on `/metrics` only when metrics are explicitly enabled. Depending on the installation, the endpoint is served either over HTTP or over HTTPS. See [Installation](../user-guide/installation.md) for deployment details.
