# `make manifests` regenerates config/crd/bases AND the chart's crds/ copy (via
# sync-chart-crds). So this check just runs it and asserts nothing changed: if the
# committed CRDs are stale, or the chart copy was hand-edited, regeneration moves
# them and git diff fails. Both files are generated; neither is edited by hand.
